## Welcome to my github! 👋

I'm a computer vision engineer with expertise in SLAM, autonomous driving, and robotics software architecture.

### I like working on:
🛣️ pretty visualizations of 3D maps

✨ lidar and point cloud data

💫 least squares optimizers

🗑️ cleaning up C++ code so that the reader gets warm tingly feelings

🥨 implementing Lie theory libraries and learning how the 3D world really works

### My history:
🍎 I currently work on the computer vision algorithms team for the vision pro group at Apple.

🚘 previously I was a founding engineer at Nuro, and helped build self driving delivery vehicles.

🚕 I spent a few summers working on self driving cars at Waymo / Google X.

☢️ before that I was a PhD student at Berkeley working on nuclear radiation mapping.

🤖 at the dawn of time I did my masters degree in Robotics at CMU, building real-time 3D maps with quadrotors.
