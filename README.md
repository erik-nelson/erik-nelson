## Welcome to my github! 👋

I'm a computer vision engineer with expertise in SLAM, autonomous driving, and robotics software architecture.

### I like working on:
🛣️ pretty visualizations of large 3D maps

✨ lidar and point cloud data

💫 least squares optimizers

🗑️ cleaning up C++ code so that the reader gets warm tingly feelings

🥨 implementing Lie theory libraries and learning how the 3D world really works

### My history:
🍎 [**2022-now**] I currently work on the computer vision algorithms team for the vision products group (VPG) @ [apple](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro)

🚘 [**2016-2022**] previously I was a founding engineer @ [nuro.ai](https://www.nuro.ai/), and built the mapping and localization stacks for self driving robots

☢️ [**2015-2016**] before that I was a PhD student @ [berkeley AI research lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) working on nuclear radiation mapping (I didn't finish...)

🚕 [**2015-2016**] I spent a few summers working on self driving cars @ [waymo](https://waymo.com/) and [google X](https://x.company/)

🤖 [**2013-2015**] I got my masters degree in [robotics @ CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), building real-time 3D maps with big lidar-equipped quadrotors

💧 [**2009-2013**] in undergrad I worked on building 3D maps of underwater caves in Malta for archaeologists

### I'm:
👶 a new dad!

🍺 a beer snob

🥾 a LASHer (Long Ass Section Hiker)

♟️embarrassing myself by learning to play Chess
