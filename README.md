## Welcome to my github! 👋

I'm a computer vision engineer with expertise in SLAM, autonomous driving, and robotics software architecture.

### I like working on:
🛣️ pretty visualizations of large 3D maps

✨ lidar and point cloud data

💫 least squares optimizers

🗑️ cleaning up C++ code so that the reader gets warm tingly feelings

🥨 implementing Lie theory libraries and learning how the 3D world really works

### My history:
🍎 I currently work on the computer vision algorithms team for the vision pro group at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro)

🚘 previously I was a founding engineer at [Nuro](https://www.nuro.ai/), and helped build self driving delivery vehicles

🚕 I spent a few summers working on self driving cars at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) and [Google X](https://x.company/)

☢️ before that I was a PhD student at Berkeley working on nuclear radiation mapping

🤖 at the dawn of time I did my masters degree in Robotics at CMU, building real-time 3D maps with quadrotors

### I'm:
👶 a new dad

🍺 a beer snob

🥾 a LASHer (Long Ass Section Hiker)

♟️embarrassing myself by learning to play Chess
